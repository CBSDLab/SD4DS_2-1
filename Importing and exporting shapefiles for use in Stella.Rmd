# Introduction

Shapefiles are a standard format for representing geographic boundaries and data. For example, data on poverty rates, home ownership rates, lead exposures, and disease incidence and prevalance are often shown as maps based on shapefiles. Common units of geographic representation in shapefiles include census tracts, zip codes, municiple, county, and state boundaries.  

While Stella interfaces don't directly support shapefiles, Stella does support importing and using scalable vector graphics (SVG) files as animations. Doing this would allow one to visualize changes in geographic information in a way that is easy to relate to and convey information about regional variations and inequities. While this can be done by manually converting files, such a process would be cumbersome and error prone when working with larger spatial datasets or when developing a more generalizable approach. Hence, a set of tools are needed for importing shapefiles and exporting them into a format that can be directly used by Stella. 

The goal of this project is to provide a set of tools and examples for automating the task of converting shapefiles into a format that can easily be used in a Stella model and interface. 

# Required packages

This notebook uses several different R packages including `tidyverse`, which provides functionality for piping of commands, filtering, importing and plotting files using ggplot, and exporting ggplot graphics as SVG files.  The `sf` package supplies functions for importing and manipulating spatial objects including functions for importing shapefiles. The `svglite` package provides functions for exporting ggplot graphics as scalable vector graphics files.  

```{r required packages}
library(tidyverse)
library(sf)
require(svglite)
```

# Sample data

The sample data comes from the publicly available Capital Area Food Bank covering the DC, Maryland, and Virginia metropolitan area. In addition to basic demographic information, the shapefile has several variables related to food inscurity for 2014 and 2015.

Variable   | Description
-----------|--------------------------------
15_FI_Rate | The estimated portion of the population in the census tract experiencing food insecurity (by CAFB standards). 15/14 indicates year measured.
15_FI_Pop | The estimated number of people in the census tract experiencing food insecurity (by CAFB standards). 15/14 indicates year measured.
15_LB_Need | The estimated pounds of food needed by the food insecure population in the census tract. 15/14 indicates year measured.
15_Distrib | The number of pounds of food distributed by CAFB and partners in the census tract. 15/14 indicates year in which the distribution took place.
15_LB_Unme | The difference between the estimated pounds of food needed and the real pounds of food distributed by CAFB and partners, representing the unmet need for food assistance in the census tract. 15/14 indicates year.

# R basics for importing, plotting, and exporting shapefile to SVG

Shapefiles are commonly available as files with a .shp extension. The `st_read` function from the `sf` package is used to import shape files.

```{r read shapefiles}
# Import DC, Maryland, and Virginia region shape files
DMV <- st_read("Data/Capital_Area_Food_Bank_Hunger_Estimates.shp")
```
Next, we plot the shapefile and export this to an SVG file.

```{r test plotting}
# Plot shape file
ggplot(data = DMV) +
  geom_sf()

# Saving the shapefile as a SVG
ggsave("DMV_demo.svg")
```

Note that in the plot above, we have the longitude and lattitude coordinates, a gray background, and gridlines, which may not want. Additionally, we don't have any data plotted. The `ggplot` package has many options for controlling graphics. For example, we can plot the food insecurity rate with a gradient as shown below.

```{r plotting food insecurity rate}
ggplot(data = DMV) +
  scale_fill_viridis_c(option = "magma") +
  geom_sf(aes(fill = F15_FI_RAT))
```

# Approach

The basic approaches uses the fact the Stella models are stored using the XMILE standard, an official extension of the XML markup language, which can be read and manipulated in R as a text file or XML object. For this exercise, we'll read and modify the model as a simple text file since what we want to do is relatively simple.[^l]

[^l]: Future versions of this could use the `XML` R package to more precisely locate and manipulate elements of the XMILE model.  

1. In RStudio, import the shapefile data, generate a ggplot figure, and export this into a SVG file.
2. In RStudio, export the data for the variable of interest to a .csv file that can imported by Stella to initialize an array.  
3. In Stella, create a model and define the variable as an array with one element for each geographic area. 
4. In Stella interface, add the SVG file as an animation object
5. In RStudio, read the Stella model and create a new version with the animation transformations linking the elements of animation object to the elements of the array.

## Importing the shapefile and exporting SVG file

We start by importing the shapefile with the relevant data and boundary descriptions into R using the `sf` package.

```{r Improting the shapefile}
DMV <- st_read("Data/Capital_Area_Food_Bank_Hunger_Estimates.shp")
```

Note that importing the data gives some useful information about the bounding box in terms of latitude and longitude coordinates. These can provide a basis for adjusting the bounding box when the shapefiles are plotted. 

```{r Plotting shape file}
# Plot DMV region without grids and other elements
ggplot(data = DMV) +
  geom_sf(fill = "red", color = "black") +
  coord_sf(xlim=c(-77.8,-76.5), ylim=c(38.4,39.4)) +
  theme(
    panel.ontop = TRUE,   ## Note: this is to make the panel grid visible in this example
    panel.grid = element_blank(),
    line = element_blank(),
    rect = element_blank(),
    text = element_blank(),
    plot.background = element_rect(fill = "white"))
```

We then save the file as an SVG file that can be imported into an Stella interface animation object. 

```{r Exporting plot to SVG file}
ggsave("Models/DMV.svg")
```

## Exporting initial values to a .csv file

The DMV data has a variable `F15_FI_RAT` representing the prevalence of food insecurity, which needs to be exported to a .csv file that can then be imported into a Stella model. Note that the dimension of the array has to equal the length of the variable. 

```{r export initial values to .csv file}
write.csv(list(F15_FI_RAT=DMV$F15_FI_RAT), file = "Models/F15_FI_RAT.csv", row.names=FALSE)
length(DMV$F15_FI_RAT)
```

## Setting up the arrays in Stella

The next step is setting up an arrayed variable in Stella with the same length as the number of rows in the data. First, create the array with the dimensions so they can be assigned when creating the variale.   

![Setting up array in Stella with dimensions that match the length of the vector](Figures/Stella_arrays.png){width=50%}

Next, create a variable with the *exact same name* as the variable being imported and dimensions using the array dimensions defined above. Making sure the name is the same is important because this is the only way that Stella will recognize the variable during the import of the data. 

![Creating a variable](Figures/Creating_variable.png){width=50%}

Finally, set up an import link to the .csv file and test the import to verify the connection. 

![Setting up an import link](Figures/Import_link.png){width=50%}

## Setting up the animation object in Stella

Next, we set up the animation object in Stella using the SVG file created earlier, and then save the model. We'll use this version of the Stella model with the .stmx to modify the model so that the elements of the animation object use values from the variable we just created. 

![Setting up animation object in Stella](Figures/Stella_animation_object.png){width=50%}

If we now open the .stmx file in a text editor (e.g., an editor that recognizes xml markup language such as Atom can be helpful here), then we can search the text for the SVG file we used to find animation object just created, which should look something like the following:

````{verbatim, lang="xml"}
<isee:animation_object x="42" y="37" width="565" height="513.445">
  <image>r../DMV.svg</image>
</isee:animation_object>
````

This animation object does not yet have the variable associated with an output attribute. For a few cases, we can set this up manually. If we do this for one variable, save the model, and then reexamine the .stmx file, we should see something like the following, which was added when we associated a variable to an element (or node) in SVG object:

````{verbatim, lang="xml"}
<isee:animation_object x="42" y="37" width="565" height="513.445">
  <image>r../DMV.svg</image>
	<isee:animation_css_transforms>
	  <isee:animation_css_transform attribute="fill-opacity" 
     selector="g:nth-child(9) &gt; path:nth-child(1)" variable="F15_FI_RAT[1]"/>
    </isee:animation_css_transforms>
  </isee:animation_object>
````

In this case, the variable is used to set the fill opacity of the census tract. Fill opacity ranges from a value of 0 to 1. With a fill color of bright red, this means taht opacity = 1.0 will be the most intense while a value of 0.0 will show the background. Other options include setting the fill color to be consistent wtih a range or changing the size of an object.

```{r create a new Stella/XMILE file with transformations of animation objects}
# Create a vector to index rows in shapefile
tract<-1:nrow(DMV)

# Read in the original model
old.stmx<-read_lines("Models/Food insecurity v3.stmx")

# Find the position of the SVG object in the Stella/XMILE model
svg.pos<-grep("DMV.svg",old.stmx)

# Copy the XMILE lines up to the point of insertion for the new objects
new.stmx<-old.stmx[1:svg.pos]

new.stmx<-c(new.stmx,
            "					<isee:animation_css_transforms>")

# Insert the animation transforms for associating the variable with opacity
for (i in tract) {
tmp<-paste0("					  ",
     "<isee:animation_css_transform attribute=\"fill-opacity\"", 
     "selector=\"g:nth-child(9) &gt; path:nth-child(",i,
     ")\" variable=\"F15_FI_RAT[",i,"]\"/>") 
new.stmx<-c(new.stmx, tmp)
}

new.stmx<-c(new.stmx,
            "					</isee:animation_css_transforms>")

# Add the rest of the Stella/XMILE model to the new model
new.stmx<-c(new.stmx,old.stmx[(svg.pos+1):length(old.stmx)])

# Write the modified model
write_lines(new.stmx,
            "Models/Food insecurity v3 with animation transforms.stmx")
```

The figure below shows the resulting animation after opening the modified file saved as "Food insecurity v3 with animation transforms.stmx". Note that because this used opacity on a 0.0 to 1.0 scale, but food insecurity is in the range of 0.0 to 0.47, the visual gradient is rather limited. We could adjust this in various ways including normalizing the variable in Stella and using a gradient instead fill opacity.

# Next steps

There are a number of ways that this approach can be extended and generalized, including:

* Extend the approach to include color scales.
* Create a function that takes a model file name , SVG filename, output file name, and variable name and then creates the modified Stella file with the animation transformations. 
* Develop a function that modifies an existing Stella model with animation objects, e.g., allowing changes to be incorporated into a new version of the model. 
* Rewrite the reading and writing of the Stella XMILE file using the `XML` package.
